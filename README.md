# DispLyrics
## Tools Used
### Manifest-Chrome Dev Tools, Selenium, BeautifulSoup4, Flask, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, DOM
## Working
### A chrome extension which scrapes the lyrics of the currently playing song from AZ-Lyrics.com using Selenium and BeautifulSoup4.    
### The python scraping script is made into a Flask app.  
### The chrome extension sends a GET request to the Flask server with the song name and the server responds back with the song's lyrics.  
### Rest of the UI on the Spotify webpage like enabling the Lyrics Button for songs with lyrics not available and getting the currently playing song is done using DOM manupulations.  
### Appropriate CSS styling is done to fit the Spotify Theme.  
### Popup page is developed so that users can get logs of whether the backend is working or not.
